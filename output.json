This could indicate that investors who seek to profit from falling equity prices are not currently targeting AAPL.\n\n## Money flow\n\nETF/Index ownership | Negative\n\nETF activity is negative and may be weakening. The net inflows of $6.87 billion over the last one-month into ETFs that hold AAPL are among the lowest of the last year and appear to be slowing.\n\n## Economic sentiment\n\nPMI by IHS Markit | Negative\n\nAccording to the latest IHS Markit Purchasing Managers&#39; Index (PMI) data, output in the Technology sector is rising. The rate of growth is weak relative to the trend shown over the past year, however, and is easing.\n\n## Credit worthiness\n\nCredit default swap | Negative\n\nThe current level displays a negative indicator. AAPL credit default swap spreads are near their highest levels for the past 1 year, which indicates the market&#39;s more negative perception of the company&#39;s credit worthiness.\n\nPlease send all inquiries related to the report to score@ihsmarkit.com.\n\nCharts and report PDFs will only be available for 30 days after publishing.\n\nThis document has been produced for information purposes only and is not to be relied upon or as construed as investment advice.
